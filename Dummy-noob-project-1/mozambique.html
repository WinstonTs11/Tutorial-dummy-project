        <p> Mozambique's political landscape is currently quite turbulent. The country recently experienced significant unrest following the presidential and parliamentary elections in October 2024. 
            The ruling party, Frelimo, claimed a landslide victory, but these results have been widely contested, leading to sustained and widespread protests2. 
            The opposition, led by Venâncio Mondlane, has called for new demonstrations, citing widespread voter fraud
            <br><br>
            The unrest reflects broader discontent with the socioeconomic status quo, including limited social mobility and growing inequalities. 
            The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has called for an extraordinary summit to address the political crisis
            <br><br>
            Mozambique's political system is a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, with the President serving as both head of state and head of government. 
            The country has a history of political instability, including a long civil war and ongoing challenges with corruption and economic mismanagement
            <br><br>
            Mozambique's political crisis is a complex and multifaceted issue. The recent elections on October 9, 2024, have sparked significant unrest and controversy. 
            The ruling party, Frelimo, declared victory with 71% of the vote, but these results have been widely condemned as fraudulent2. 
            Opposition leader Venâncio Mondlane, who received only 21% of the preliminary vote, has called for fresh elections and announced new protests across all provinces
