    <h2>Political Views</h2>
    <button class="accordion">Click to Read More</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><strong>1. Democratic Principles and Multi-Party System</strong>
            <br>
            South Africa is a parliamentary democracy, with a Constitution hailed as one of the most progressive globally.
            <br>
            The country operates under a multi-party system. However, the <strong>African National Congress (ANC)</strong> has dominated national politics since 1994, advocating for transformation, racial equality, and economic inclusivity.
            <hr>
            <strong>2. Political Spectrum</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>Left-Wing Views</strong>
            <br>
            The ANC and its allies, such as the <strong>South African Communist Party (SACP)</strong> and <strong>Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU)</strong>, emphasize social welfare, economic redistribution, and land reform to address apartheid-era inequalities.
            The <strong>Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)</strong>, a leftist party, advocate for radical economic policies, including land expropriation without compensation and nationalization of key industries.
            <br>
            <strong>Center to Right-Wing Views</strong>
            <br>
            The <strong>Democratic Alliance (DA)</strong>, South Africa's largest opposition party, promotes liberal democratic values, free-market policies, and accountability in governance.
            <br>
            Other smaller right-leaning parties, like the <strong>Freedom Front Plus (FF+)</strong>, focus on minority rights and conservative economic policies.
            <hr>
            <strong>3. Racial and Economic Divisions</strong>
            <br>
            Politics in South Africa is deeply influenced by racial history. Many political debates revolve around issues of racial equity, land reform, and addressing economic disparities between historically privileged white South Africans and marginalized black South Africans.
            <br>
            Economic challenges, including high unemployment and inequality, dominate political discourse, with parties proposing varying solutions.
            <hr>
            <strong>4. Youth and Activism</strong>
            <br>
            South African youth play a significant role in shaping political views, with movements like #FeesMustFall highlighting concerns over education, employment, and systemic inequality.
            <br>
            Political activism and public protests remain prominent, reflecting citizens' engagement with governance and rights.
            <hr>
            <strong>5. Foreign Policy</strong>
            <br>
            South Africa positions itself as a leader in Africa, advocating for pan-Africanism and regional cooperation.
            <br>
            It aligns with BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) to promote global south interests, though its stance on controversial issues (e.g., Russia-Ukraine war) has drawn mixed reactions.
            <hr>
            <strong>6. Corruption and Governance Issues</strong>
            <br>
            Public dissatisfaction with corruption scandals, especially within the ANC, has shaped political views, increasing support for opposition parties and civil society organizations.
            <br>
            Governance reforms and anti-corruption measures remain high on the agenda for many voters.

            <strong>2. Growth Trends</strong>
            GDP growth in 2023 was sluggish at about 0.5%, impacted by electricity shortages (load shedding), logistical inefficiencies, and weak global demand for exports.
            <br>
            Projections for 2024 estimate growth at 1%, reflecting slight recovery due to renewable energy investments and reforms in infrastructure
            <hr>
            <strong>3. Key Challenges</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>Energy Crisis:</strong> Load shedding due to insufficient electricity supply hampers businesses and reduces productivity.
